	* Reverted list_t's following an lkml thread
	* Simplified logging output

	* Version 0.0.6 released

2002-04-18 Richard Russon <ldm@flatcap.org>

	* Reworked the fragment handling code.  Happy now.
	* Lots of tidying up.
	* combined out_of_range and relative.

2002-04-12 Richard Russon <ldm@flatcap.org>

	* Lots of renaming.  The VBLK types have become a name-version hybrid.
	* More range checking.  The disk size is used to verify the privhead,
	  the privhead for the tocblock and the tocblocks for the vmdb.
	* Added a version number to ldminfo.

2002-03-09 Richard Russon <ldm@flatcap.org>

	* I've finally managed to decipher all the flags and I now
	  understand the VBLK numbering.
	* Added checks for the lengths of VBLKs.
	* Removed some redundant checks of VBLKs.

2002-02-24 Jakob Kemi <jakob.kemi@telia.com>

	* Total redesign of multipart VBLK record handling.
	  Should be faster and cleaner now. It still needs some polishing.
	* Switched to list_for_each_safe() when using kfree().
	* Probably introduced some new bugs ;)

2002-02-23 Richard Russon <ldm@flatcap.org>

	* Replace hex conversion routines with a sscanf
	* Remove lots of assumptions from ldminfo's copy option

2002-02-09  Jakob Kemi <jakob.kemi@telia.com>

	* Code cleanups and commenting
	* Major was rewrite of:
	  ldm_validate_partition_table()
	  ldm_validate_privheads()
	  ldm_validate_tocblocks()
	* ldm_create_db_partition() is now obsolete and removed.
	* Converted tab length in ldm_md.c from 4 to 8

2001-02-08  Richard Russon <ldm@flatcap.org>

	* Build fixes.  It should now compile cleanly against late 2.4 and 2.5,
	  without resorting to black arts.
	* Tidied code, BUG_ON, BOOL, __attribute__ printf

2001-12-31  Richard Russon <ldm@flatcap.org>

	* Version 0.0.5 released
	* ldminfo works properly again

2001-12-19  Richard Russon <ldm@flatcap.org>

	* Made ldminfo compile again
	* Converted all GUIDs to binary
	* Minor bugfix for extended VBLKs

2001-12-14 Jakob Kemi <jakob.kemi@telia.com>

	* LDM MD volumes now check for valid GUID.
	* Added ldmutil for setting volume types (good for persistent superblock md)
	  I had to revert to rewriting old ldmutil, in order to KISS.
	* Updated changelog for the last month ;)

2001-11-24 Jakob Kemi <jakob.kemi@telia.com>

	* Further rewrite
	  All use of buffer_head is now gone.
	  Moved pages into vblk.ext, separate pagelist now unnecessary.
	  Merged ldm_get_vblks() and ldm_get_buffers() into one simpler function.
	  struct vblkdb is now known as ldb.
	  Again smaller source and memory footprint.
	* Moved adding of native LDM MD volumes to init/main.c where it belongs.
	* More tidying.

2001-11-20 Jakob Kemi <jakob.kemi@telia.com>

	* Big rewrite
	  Added vblk.ext structure for multiple vblk-records.
	  Vblk types now stored in different lists (in vblkdb struct).
	  Separate list for partition-sorting no longer necessary.
	  Now supporting vblk records of arbitrary size.
	  Smaller source and memory footprint.
	* Lots of tidying.

2001-11-13 Jakob Kemi <jakob.kemi@telia.com>

	* Added support for native LDM stripe(RAID-0) volumes. (ldm_md.c)
	  (config option CONFIG_LDM_MD)

	* Misc. fixes, support for partition types
	* Added md autodetect
