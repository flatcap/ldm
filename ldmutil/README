* ldmutil doesn't deal well with vblk entries with > 1 records.
  The only types affected by this is VOLUME, COMPONENT and PARTITION.
  I haven't yet seen any such vblk with > 1 records.
	
* ldmutil doesn't check for bad parent_id and object_id in vblks.
  I'm not sure if this is necessary, any db that broken will
  probably not work in Win2k/XP anyway.
	
* ldmutil assumes many things, for eg. where database is located (only
  affects the copy database operation). VBLK size (ldmutil will
  spit out a message and quit if size isn't 128 bytes)

* Support for Win2k/XP should be trivial, modify types.h, endian.h and
  create a new diskio.cpp.

main.cpp	--	main program file, parse command line etc
types.h		--	Definition of data types. (add compiler specific
			for platforms which lacks linux/types.h.)
endian.h	--	functions handling endianess (add generic
			for platforms where asm/byteorder.h doesn't exists.)
error.h		--	Object containing error message for throwing as an
			exception.
diskio.cpp/h	--	I/O-class for sector level file/device I/O.
			(add an implementation for Win2k/XP.)
ldm_db.cpp/h	--	main ldm class, the complete database and methods
ldm_dump.cpp/h	--	functions for dumping info on objects in ldm db
ldm_parse.cpp/h	--	functions for reading and writing various ldm structs
