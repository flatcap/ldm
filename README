Logical Disk Manager (Dynamic Disk) Tool and Driver.

There are two packages included here.  A userland tool to dump the contents of
a Window 2000 LDM Disk.  Also there's a Linux Filesystem driver.  You need to
know what you're doing to use this.

The packages are part of the Linux-NTFS Project which is hosted on SourceForge:

  http://linux-ntfs.sourceforge.net

I've included a prebuilt copy of the tool in the .tar If you want to build it
yourself you need the kernel header files, then "make" should do the trick.
If it doesn't build without errors, then you'll need to know your way around
the kernel to fix things.

LDMInfo can be used in three ways:

	ldminfo /dev/hdb		Standard partition list

	ldminfo --dump /dev/hdb		Detailed dump of LDM Database

	ldminfo --copy /dev/hdb		Write the LDM Database to a file

In addition, you can add the --debug flag.  This will show you what's
going on inside the code.  Not at all interesting, but vital to help
us debug the application.

The standard partition list looks something like this:

 Device | Offset Bytes    Sectors    MiB | Size   Bytes    Sectors    MiB
 -------+--------------------------------+-------------------------------
 hdb    |            0          0      0 |     21159936      41328     20
 hdb1   |        32256         63      0 |      5242880      10240      5
 hdb2   |      5275136      10303      5 |      5242880      10240      5
 hdb3   |     10518016      20543     10 |      3145728       6144      3
 hdb4   |     13663744      26687     13 |      6291456      12288      6
